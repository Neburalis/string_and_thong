/*
this algorithm (k=33) was first reported by dan bernstein many years ago in comp.lang.c.
another version of this algorithm (now favored by bernstein) uses xor:
hash(i) = hash(i - 1) * 33 ^ str[i];
the magic of number 33 (why it works better than many other constants, prime or not)
has never been adequately explained.

/*
this algorithm was created for sdbm (a public-domain reimplementation of ndbm) database library.
it was found to do well in scrambling bits, causing better distribution of the keys and fewer splits.
it also happens to be a good general hashing function with good distribution.
the actual function is hash(i) = hash(i - 1) * 65599 + str[i];
what is included below is the faster version used in gawk.
[there is even a faster, duff-device version]
the magic prime constant 65599 (2^6 + 2^16 - 1) was picked out of thin air
while experimenting with many different constants. this is one of the algorithms
used in berkeley db (see sleepycat) and elsewhere.
